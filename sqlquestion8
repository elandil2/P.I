This question is regex question but  im using online ide on https://sqliteonline.com/  and it returned errors so many times .. no such function: regex,  no such function: REGEXP, no such function: REGEXP_SUBSTR

Also searched for parse tag and urls subjects to find solution.

replace(column, search, replace) column we want to change, search whatever we looking for and replace it.replace function working like that.

Tried this on ide  as regex : <url>(https:\/\/|http:\/\/)*.*<\/url>
